    Overall idea:
        If the seed point belongs to an object (votes_label_mask == 1),
        then we require it to vote for the object center.

        Each seed point may vote for multiple translations v1,v2,v3
        A seed point may also be in the boxes of multiple objects:
        o1,o2,o3 with corresponding GT votes c1,c2,c3

        Then the loss for this seed point is:
            min(d(v_i,c_j)) for i=1,2,3 and j=1,2,3
